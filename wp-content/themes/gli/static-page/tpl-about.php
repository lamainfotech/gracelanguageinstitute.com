            </div>
            <p>Many of us write every day to communicate with coworkers, friends, and family. But if you’re a student or work in a field that involves writing, writing is one of your regular tasks.</p>

                What is writer’s block?
            </h3>

            <p>Writer’s block is the condition of being unable to write productively. The obstacle isn’t physical; it’s mental. When you have writer’s block, it can feel like the creative part of your brain lost its Wi-Fi signal. When you want to do some creative writing, writer’s block is frustrating. When you have a deadline coming up, writer’s block is anxiety provoking.</p>

            <p>Writer’s block isn’t the same as procrastination. The key difference is that with procrastination, you avoid writing (or other obligations) because of some kind of stressor, which might or might not be connected to the task at hand. With writer’s block, you want to write, but your brain just can’t seem to produce anything worth writing. Writer’s block can take the form of a lack of ideas or difficulty finding the right words to communicate your ideas. Writer’s block can last days, weeks, or longer.</p>

            <p>There are a lot of possible causes of writer’s block. You might be preoccupied with other things, or perhaps you’ve written yourself into a corner—or you’re creatively tapped out and feel uninspired. When writer’s block keeps you from working on an assignment, it might be that you don’t understand the subject matter thoroughly enough to write with confidence. Or you might simply not be interested in the topic. It happens, more often than you might think—but you still need to turn in your assignment.</p>
